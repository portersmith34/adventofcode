Day1:
- you can store the lines of a file in a list to limit iteration to a section of the list
  example: for line in linesList[:10]: - to only iterate over first 10 lines
- use line.strip() to remove whitespace and newlines

Day2:
- re.findall() is better than re.search() for most cases
- Correct regex pattern starts with r - (r"[1-9]")
- Use a comma in print statement to print different types on the same line 
  example: print("count:", 100)
