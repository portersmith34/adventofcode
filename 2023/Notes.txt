Day1:
- you can store the lines of a file in a list to limit iteration to a section of the list
  example: for line in linesList[:10]: - to only iterate over first 10 lines
- use line.strip() to remove whitespace and newlines

Day2:
- re.findall() is better than re.search() for most cases
- Correct regex pattern starts with r - (r"[1-9]")
- Use a comma in print statement to print different types on the same line 
  example: print("count:", 100)
- You do not need regex, sometimes use string functions
  example: string.replace(), string.split()
- You don't need parenthesis in if statement - (if count < 10:)
- Use num ** 2 to square a number

Day3:
- Use [-1] to access the last item instead of [len(array)-1]
- String.replace() has a 3rd parameter to set how many instances to replace
  example: mystring.replace(" ", "", 3) will replace the first 3 spaces
